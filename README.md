# Emoji generation script

I was looking auto NFT creator scripts for publish some NFT.I found some scripts to generate images.
This script genetares Emojis with 4 different class ,5 different mouths, 4 different eyes.
Basically i didnt use extra formulas to generate images ,just used random-randint functions.

- Python 3 

- Pillow - python library to generate images -

- NumPy - python library to work with arrays -
